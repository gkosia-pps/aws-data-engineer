VPC: virtual private cloud
     its a regional resource (can containes resources from multi-az)

     A VPC has CIDR Range: IPS available in the VPC (10.0.0.0/16)

     By default in AWS we have one VPC for each region
     Each VPC has a public subnet

Subnets: allows to partition the VPC
         its az resource: resources belong to same az
         A subnet can be public or private

Rout tables: 
    each VPC has route tables that defines how the traffic flows between the subnets


Inbternet Gateway:

    Its the door of VPC to connect to the internet
    The public subnets of the VPC will have a route to the public gateway

NAT Gateways:

    It is used from resources in Private subnets to access the internet but not be reached throught the internet
    1. We provision a NAT Gateway in the public subnet
    2.  -> Private resource in private subnet speak to NAT Gateway in public subnet
        -> NAT Gateway speak to Internet gateway
        -> Internet Gateway speak to Internet
