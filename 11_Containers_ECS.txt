Docker agent/deamon run on top of an ec2 instance
On docker agent we can start multiple containers


Iamges can be stored:
    Dockerhub: public images
    AWS ECR: private/public repository

When launching a container in AWS ECS we are launching an ECS Task on an ECS Cluster

Launch type:
    ec2: launch the compute as ec2 insdtances that i have to provision and manage  
         the ECS Cluster is build using the ec2 instances
         each ec2 must run the ecs agent, agent will register the instace on the ecs cluster
    Fargate: compute is serverless, it runs the ECS Tasks and assign the cpu/memory we specify in container
             it will create an ec2 autoscale group that will store the configuration (auto scale instances)


IAM Roles:

    If we have the ec2 launch type:
        We have to create an ec2 instance profile that will be used from ECS Agent

    ECS Task role:  (app permissions)
        for both launch types, 
        each task will need its own role with custom permissions

Load balancer:

    If we want to expose the services to public(api, web app) we need to add an Application Load balances

Data volumes:
    To persist data on ECS we have to mount volumes that point to an EFS on each ECS tasks
    Apps mount volumes that point on the same EFS
    EFS: persistance, multi-az shared storage for containers
