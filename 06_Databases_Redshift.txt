Redshift:
    Fully managed, scalable MPP dwh

Durability: 
    Data are stored to original worker node, on a replica node and to s3

Distribution style:
    AUTO: redshift will choose based on data size
          large size => EVEN, small size ALL

    EVEN: round robin
    KEY: hash based on column
    ALL: replicate to all nodes

Sort keys:
    Physical stored order
    Statistics kept for each block (min, max, ) that sed for block pruning

    Types:
        Single: single column
        Compound: combination of columns
        Interleaved: give same weight to all columns on sorting

Copy command:

    Support from s3, EMR, DynamoDB, remote hosts
    Requires a manifest and IAM role
    manifest is a file that contains in json all files to be loaded

Unload command: export data to s3

Auto-copy from s3
zero-ETL from Aurora to Redshift
Streaming ingestion from Kinesis data stream or MSK


Spectrum:
    Query unstructure data on top of s3
    Can scale horizontally
